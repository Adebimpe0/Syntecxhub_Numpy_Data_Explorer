# Syntecxhub_Numpy_Data_Explorer
Week 1 Project – NumPy Data Explorer (Syntecxhub Data Science Internship)
# NumPy Data Explorer

This project is part of the **Syntecxhub Data Science Internship – Week 1 (Project 1)**.  
It demonstrates foundational NumPy operations including array creation, indexing, slicing, 
mathematical/statistical computations, reshaping, broadcasting, saving/loading arrays, 
and performance comparison between Python lists and NumPy arrays.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Understand and work with NumPy arrays  
- Index and slice arrays  
- Perform axis-wise mathematical operations  
- Calculate basic statistical values (mean, min, max, etc.)  
- Use reshaping and broadcasting for efficient computation  
- Save and load arrays using `.npy` files  
- Compare performance with standard Python lists
